# Flower-Detection-using-Streamlit

Welcome to the Flower Detection using Streamlit GitHub repository. This project aims to provide an interactive web application to classify and identify flowers based on user-uploaded images. Using a pre-trained machine learning model integrated with Streamlit, this app can recognize different species of flowers, helping enthusiasts, botanists, and hobbyists explore the fascinating world of flora.


## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of flowers to be identified.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: The application provides immediate classification results.
- **Visualization**: View confidence scores for each predicted flower species.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices, ensuring a good user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Built With

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - The framework used to create the web application.
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) / [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - For creating and training the machine learning model.
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) - For image processing in Python.
